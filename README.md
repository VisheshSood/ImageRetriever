# ImageRetriever
Get mouse click location of Image.
Keep track of files you have uploaded.

This simple program allows you to add as many images (jpg/jpeg format) of size less than 4.2 megabytes. It should then allow you to click any image and get it's relative x and y co-ordinate at that specific point. 

Currently working on getting last file to show up again after deleting last function. Time restraints have kept this out of scope for now.

This was made through HTTP and C# on Xamarin Studio.

Any issues regarding opening files, please contact me at vsood@uw.edu
